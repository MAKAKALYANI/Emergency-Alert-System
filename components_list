## üìù Notes

- Ensure the **GPS module has clear sky access** for accurate location detection.
- The **Bluetooth module** must be pre-paired with the mobile device to receive data.
- The **battery should be rechargeable** or have adequate capacity for mobile use.
- Use **heat shrink tubing or insulation tape** for wire safety in final enclosures.
